# creativity
project for Statistical Learning and Data Mining course

This is a group project for the course in Advanced Statistical Learning and Data Mining at UTSA (fall 2020). With two of my classmates, Ben Graf and Cong Zhang, I investigated the effects of social and economic capital on self-perceptions of creativity. For this project, we analyzed data from the National Archive of Data on Arts and Culture: https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/NADAC/studies/37853
